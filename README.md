# Simple-BMI-Calculator
A simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator built in python using Google Colab. This project allows users to input their weight and height and calculates their BMI. It also provides a category for the BMI (Underweight, Normal, Overweight and Obese). 

Features:
1. Calculate BMI based on user input (weight in kg and height in meters).
2. Display the BMI category
(Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese).
3. Simple and easy-to-use implementation.

How to Run:
1. Open the notebook on Google Colab:
BMI Calculator - Google Colab
2. In the Colab notebook, run the code cells by clicking the "Play" button on the left side of each cell or by pressing Shift + Enter.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to input your weight and height. The BMI will be calculated and displayed, along with the BMI category. 

Example Input and Output:
1. Input:
• Weight: 70 kg
Height: 1.75 m
Output:
• BMI: 22.86
• Category: Normal

2. Input:
Weight: 50 kg
Height: 1.60 m
Output:
BMI: 19.53
• Category: Normal

3. Input:
• Weight: 95 kg
• Height: 1.70 m
Output:
BMI: 32.88
• Category: Obese

Improvements:
1. Add more units (e.g., pounds and inches).
2. Include error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values).
3. Create a history feature to track recent BMI calculations.

Additional Information:
• BMI Categories:
• Underweight: BMI < 18.5
• Normal: 18.5 ≤ BMI < 24.9
• Overweight: 25 ≤ BMI < 29.9
• Obese: BMI ≥ 30
